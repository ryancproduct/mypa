# MyPA Notes PWA â€” Unified Implementation Plan


## Current State Snapshot (Updated: Sept 17, 2025)
- âœ… **Phase 1 shipped**: responsive PWA, Claude-assisted task management, offline support, security baseline
- âœ… **Vercel Deployment**: Successfully deployed and accessible at https://mypa-4iid0e9x4-ryan-clements-projects-75004587.vercel.app
- âœ… **Build System Fixed**: Removed Linux-specific rollup dependencies, builds work on both macOS and Vercel
- âœ… **TypeScript Errors Resolved**: Fixed notification service type issues and imports
- Phase 2 pilot features (smart rollover, priority suggestions, advanced search) exist but need hardening for production traffic
- Known gaps: browser-exposed Anthropic key, duplicated data pipelines, uneven performance at scale, UX friction on mobile, no backend-owned AI orchestration

## Guiding Objectives (Next 8 Weeks)
1. Eliminate critical security risks and centralize backend orchestration for AI + data sync
2. Unify storage, synchronization, and caching to keep tasks consistent across devices
3. Improve perceived performance and resilience of the UI for large day/week views
4. Elevate assistant capabilities toward "acts-on-your-behalf" workflow while maintaining trust and auditability
5. Prepare platform APIs for partner integrations and future MCP ecosystem work

- [ ] Implement assistant activity feed with audit trail links
- [ ] Integrate external calendar availability UI into scheduling flows
- [ ] Surface webhook/API key management screens for partner integrations

## Cross-Cutting Tracks

#### Backend
- [ ] Harden security posture (CSP, dependency scanning, JWT session lifecycle, secrets rotation)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring/alerting (APM, API latency dashboards)

#### Frontend
- [ ] Maintain accessibility and performance regression checks in CI (Lighthouse CI thresholds)
- [ ] Expand automated test suite (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright scenarios)

#### Shared
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Document architecture decisions, runbooks, and API contracts as features land
- [ ] Stand up Sentry + LogRocket for error tracking and session replay
- [ ] Roll out GA4 + Mixpanel dashboards for success metrics tracking

## Recent Accomplishments (Sept 17, 2025)

### âœ… **Deployment & Build Infrastructure**
- Fixed Vercel deployment issues by removing Linux-specific rollup package from build script
- Resolved `vercel.json` configuration errors (removed invalid `cache` property)
- Successfully deployed to production: https://mypa-4iid0e9x4-ryan-clements-projects-75004587.vercel.app
- Cleaned and regenerated dependencies to ensure cross-platform compatibility

### âœ… **Code Quality & TypeScript**
- Fixed TypeScript errors in notification services (`appService.ts`, `useNotifications.ts`)
- Corrected method signatures and type imports for `Task` interface
- Separated notification title from options object to match proper API structure
- Added proper type imports from `../types/index`

### âœ… **Development Workflow**
- Established proper Vercel CLI authentication and deployment process

- Confirmed production build generates optimized assets (524.89 KiB precached)

### ðŸ”„ **Current Focus Areas**
- **CRITICAL**: Address browser-exposed Anthropic API key security risk
- **HIGH**: Unify dual storage systems (Supabase + File System API)
- **MEDIUM**: Performance optimizations for large task lists
- **MEDIUM**: Mobile UX improvements and gesture refinements

## Success Metrics
- Performance: FCP < 1.5s, TTI < 3s, bundle < 500KB gzip, API p95 < 500ms

## Dependencies & Open Questions
- Finalize hosting choice for API gateway (Railway vs Fly.io vs Lambda) and networking requirements
- Decide on Supabase RLS strategy and migration sequencing from Markdown backups
- Clarify compliance needs for storing communication transcripts (privacy/legal)
- Define approval model for AI-initiated external communications (human-in-the-loop thresholds)

## Backlog / Parking Lot
- Share target integration (iOS/Android share sheets, browser extension)
- Theme marketplace + custom design tokens
- MCP marketplace partnerships and revenue model exploration
- Enterprise admin (role-based access, SOC2 prep)
